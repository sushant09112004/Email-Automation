  bio: `I am a Full-Stack Developer with over a year of hands-on experience, primarily working with React, Next.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js. I have built and deployed multiple real-world applications with a strong focus on clean UI design, scalable backend APIs, and maintainable codebases. One of my notable projects is AI ToolBook, a live platform for discovering and exploring AI tools, where I contributed to frontend development, feature implementation, and performance optimization. I also developed MediMitra, a voice-enabled medicine reminder system for senior citizens, integrating voice assistants and OCR-based workflows. I am currently a final-year engineering student at Pune University and actively looking for opportunities where I can contribute as a developer while continuing to grow technically.`
